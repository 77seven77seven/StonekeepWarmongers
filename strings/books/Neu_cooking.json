<p>Serving the lords and ladies of the court requires a skilled hand at the hearth, but commoners too can eat well if they do not scorn the wisdom of the butlers.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;POWDER AND YE BASE FOODES&quot;</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To grinde the grain, and pour water into the powder, kneading and then adding more powder, is the secret of ye base dough, and should be known even by peasant toddlers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A lite snack can be eaten any way you fancie, but a goode meal is best served on a platter, for keeping freshe longer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Making butter requires milk in a bucket, with pure salte added, then churned mightily with a wooden spoone.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-Making cheese requires salted milk like butter, but instead of a spoon, use a cloth to strain out fresh cheese. Add four handfuls of fresh cheese to a cloth to make a cheese wheel, but let it cure before opening.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-Pie dough is made by rolling butter dough slices, and one piece needs to be baked so it makes for a good pie bottom. Fill it, then add a pie dough as roofing, then into the oven it goes!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Soupes are not fit for a noble I say, but it do fill the belly well when the cupboards are meagre. To a pot with water, placed on a hearth, add what ye may to make something edible, best served in a bowle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most nobles enjoy expensive spices on their meals. To make a pepper steak, ye olde fryng pan on a hearth will do well to sizzle raw meat, and the resulting steak can be peppered from a mill, once laid on a table. Place on a platter if ye wishe it, then serve.</p>
